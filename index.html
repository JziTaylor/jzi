            I only ask that you come equipped with decorum, honesty, openness, kindness, courage, compassion for yourself, compassion for others, patience, and a willingness to listen.

        <div class="bubble wands">
            I know exactly what I want out of life. I am very patient, however, lets cut to the chase.
            I like to heal and explore with MDMA and Psychedelics. I like to experiment with sex and tantra. I like to read
            meditate, pray, journal, self reflect, color, draw, play my didgeridoo, write, laugh, learn, run, do calisthenics, weightlift,
            do yoga, stretch, dance, study music, eat mindfully.

            I'm interested in exploring polyamourous relationships with multiple women.

            I dream of a large homestead and a community/family

        <div class="bubble wands">
            I love to cook! Especially, cheap, healthy, and whole foods. I eat very simple (mostly unprocessed) diet
            consisting of soups, stews, salads, lentils, herbs, spice, vegetables, fruit, smoothies, yogurt, homemade bread, homemade juice,
            cheese, and on occasion, some desserts. I may one day concede and eat meat but only if I raise and slaughter the animal or hunt the animal
            myself. And even then, I still may not decide to consume the meat. Also I love sweet potatoes! Like a lot! Like them baked, roasted, braised, steamed, mashed, souffle'd, turned into
            waffles, turned into bread, roasted over a fire. I frequently make cuisine inspired by India, China, Italy, Carribbean, Africa, Latin America and I'm an extremely resourceful cook.

        </div>
        <div class="bubble swords">
            I don't "smoke" weed. I stopped combusting the herb and now I mostly only vaporize it, inhale the vapor, and make edibles with the vaped bud.
            This is about a daily ritual for me, though, I recognize it disrupts by ability to dream vividly.

            I'm going to create an empire that I'm proud of, hence, my pride. My pride will have royal lionesses and we'll raise princes and princesses.
            We'll all work hard, relax harder, fight hard, play harder, grow hard, learn hard, love hard, collabborate hard, and live in harmony with the lush wild gardens that surround the lands we live on.
            It'll feature sustainable and reneweable energy, independent water, luxary architecture with a rustic feel made from local materials and inspired by ancient Persian and Egyptian styles.

            It doesn't matter how young or how old you are. If my ambitious dream and vision resonates with you, then let's connect and agree to grow ourself the point where we can act and commit.
            I don't have commitment issues. I Know exactly what I want to commit to and I won't compromise.

        <div class="bubble cups">
            My archetype is that of the ideal lover. That has shot me in the foot a few times in the past but now I know better. I set boundaries and only water those
            whom truly want to grow into my lofty goals, dreams, and visions. If you're serious, we can let eachother be vulnerable to the concept of love.

            I believe one must not reduce love to a feeling. Love is an action and continuous process that I believe necessitates collaboration and trust.

            I have grown beyond dating for short term pleasure. I have a plan for long term vision. So if my vision resonates with you, lets
            accept eachother where we are now and choose to intersect wherever in the future serves us.

            I'm capable of loving almost any woman, so therefore, I restrict my love and attention to those I truly align with.

            My lion's mane of locs, tattoos, piercings, and jewelry are all symbolically important to me. Do they have meaning?
            questionable. Are they symbolic? Of course!

        </div>
        <div class="bubble swords">
            By birthright, I may be considered a Christian. Yes and with the unique encouragement to question and challenge. Therefore,
            I believe that Jesus Christ of Nazareth, the historical figure and allegorical symbol, and his gospel, or "good news" was overshadowed
            by his worship. Christ is literally within was the message. Raise the christ oil that lay dormant at the base of your spine up the 33
            vertebrae to be crucified at the cross of the ida and pingala where they meet in the sea of the medulla oblongata. I draw from worldwide religions,
            philosophies, and frameworks such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Zen, Tantra, Stoicism, Rastafarianism, African spirituality (diverse as it may be), and world-wide divination traditions.

            On alcohol, theres a time and a place for everything. For alcohol, that time and place is NOT every day, every occassion, all the time, or always in excess.
            Trust me, I know. I managed a liquor store for over a year and was president of my fraternity. That being said, I'll make excuses for red wine, I appreciate a nice, cold, beer
            (prefrably IPA) out the pint, and I really like Henny.

            I'm looking to learn and share perspectives and I cannot/will not tolerate intolerance, bigotry, passive aggressive behavior, silent warrior behavior,
            or resistance to listen and change.

            My archetype is that of the king. I am born to lead and serve my people. My sun, rising, mars, and jupiter are all in my first house of Cancer. So that means
            I lead emotionally and intuitively. So when you need help solving problems, ask for help. And if you just need some time / space to
            process on your own, just say so. In either case, you must speak up and trust the sancitity of your true, authentic experience embodied by your words will be met with understanding, acceptance, and love.

            Do what you gotta do to make money. When I was 2-3 years old, my favorite song to sing was "I'm in love with a dancer" by T-pain.
            Very poetic, and prophetic too. I find myself allured, seduced, mezmerized, and magnetized by the electric sexual pull of erotic dancing. I won't pay the club for that experience, I need that
            at home.

            I don't accept "traditional" gender roles. I like cooking (might not cook your favs, that might just be on you, maybe, we'll see).
            Cleaning, childrearing, and homesteading are all process which require joint effort. Let's just divide the work dynamically according to
            people involved, skills, traits, inclinations, temperment, experience, talent, confidence, resolve, current situation, perception of global past or significant events,
            desire for the future, and literally anything else that is relevant.

            I wouldn't get attached to the label "traditional". Some patterns may rise naturally and that is okay but patterns don't imply something

            I study jazz and contemporary renditions of the afro-american music tradition. I'm currently obsessed with drill out the NY scene like M Row and 41

            2024 is the year of truth. 2025 will be the year of light. Hold steady and prepare for an American Reniassance. Like a small seed germinated in the dark
            of the warm, moist soil, the light is blinding at first. During this transitional time inbetween ignorance and knowledge, earth and air, we've been gassing this seed
            with water and nurturing but its time to grow in the fire. Time to cut the umbilical cord loose and stop babying it because it needs to grow up. It needs a new fire but it first must accept
            its history and where it stands currently with race, social injustice, inequity, religion, sexuality. Then it has to move on! It has to acknowledge that poverty should not be on the table as a standard of living for any American at all
            regardless of their color or ethnic background. We need to forge a new American identity, with shared culture, values, way of life, customs, ideas. We all need to get together and advocate for ourselves, listen to others, freey express our needs and wants of one another, and
            make practical negotiations about whats feasible. And though we may have our values and customs, be them enjoyable to all and non-exclusionary (maybe not necessarily inclusive but certainly
            not exclusive. Especially on lines such as race, color, gender identity, sexuality, or religion). By all means, exclude haters. Good to define a clear line on who is the enemy
            to establish group identity. However, exlusion on lines of race and xenophobia are not creative, just mean.

        <div class="bubble pentacles">
            I believe curently, a decision is awaiting us. We collapse a seedling to our own divisiveness or we collectively agree to establish our roots. We face evolution or extinction.
            Some say its like we all hold hands and sing kumbaya. I predict its more like we all hold hands and brace for impact. This is make or break and everyone needs to be included in our prosperity except our enemies. Everyone
            must agreed to shed their old labels, and embrace new labels and new meanings.

        <div class="bubble wands">
            Afro-Americans, negus, black folk are torn by an identification with slavery and a promised reality of "freedom". Some black people think they are still slaves because they are black. Some black people think reality is not
            shaped by this country's entanglement of slavery and race. I would disagree with both. Yet, in our me, me, me, me attitude (that fell on deaf, so-called "racist" ears) we forgot
            to forgive and commit to the ideals of hope and trust. Our hope and trust has been spread so sparse since our mass displacement, dehumanization, and disenfranchisement.

            Truth is, we need white people to be confident and self-assured in themself too. They are so attacked, defensive, traumatized, and scared themselves that they can't hardly open their ears
            to our yelps and cries. It is time for everybody speak up and everybody to listen. We all crave pride in our heritage. We should all have supremacist attitude towards our work, culture, and background that
            doesn't imply prejudice against historically discriminated against groups. You should be proud of what you are and who you are, affording that same dignity to everyone else.

            Black people should be black and proud. White people should be white and proud. White people shouldn't have to pick between guilt and shame or racism. Both of these options
            are sad and/or pitifull and emasculating. All Americans need a sense of pride, white people included. We gotta let white people create something they can be proud of.

            Afro- American talent and creative energy should no longer gatekeep participation by white America. Yet, white America surely cannot hope to grow creatively without first recognizing we are ahead of them in this pursuit, and without our encouragement
            to race alongside us and push the boundries of art. Everyone regardless of skin color must produce art authentic to themself, that includes black people not imitating life styles they do not align with too! Research the origins and development of Jazz music as an allegory for now.

        <div class="bubble cups">
            We'll also need to reconsider gender roles and their place in our language and perception. Dating feels upside down right now across hetersexual America because
            women are being recognized for their value, contributions, and competence, which is finally flourishing after a long period of suppression and downpression. Men's current states feels challenged because we've built our construct for masculinity
            on the sands of physical providing and co-dependency. But women don't necessarily "need" us, they need new men they can trust
            and who can fulfill a dynamic role that changes to meet the needs of new situations.

            Suck my pronouns! Mine are This Nigga / That Nigga (And yes! Those ARE pronouns). Respect peoples right to privacy and respect their choice to adapt their preferred labels to match their comfort within the context.
            Let's commit to real change becuase it is good, not just institute performative "change" because its popular and/or profitable to appear such way.
